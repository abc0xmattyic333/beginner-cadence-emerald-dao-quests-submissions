# What are the 5 Cadence Programming Language Pillars?

# 1. Safety and Security: Every Smart Contract must be secure. Cadence maximizes efficiency while maintaining the highest levels of safety and security. It accomplishes this because of its insanely strong type system, separation between contracts and transactions, and Resource Oriented Programming (see #5).

# 2. Clarity: Code should be easy to read, especially Smart Contract code so that we, as users, can verify it is safe. This is achieved by making the code declarative and allowing the developer to express their intentions directly. Cadence makes those intentions very clear by design, which, along with readability, make auditing and reviewing more efficient.

# 3. Approachability: The way Cadence is written is very familiar to other programming languages, making it easy to transition to if you have prior experience.

# 4. Developer Experience: The developer should be able to debug in an easy manner, understand what does where, and not feel frustrated. Cadence does this by making error messages very clear.

# 5. Resource Oriented Programming: This is by far the most important, and will take up about 80% of our time in this course. Cadence at its core uses things called ***resources***, and they define pretty much everything we do on Flow.
